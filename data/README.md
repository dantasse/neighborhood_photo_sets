Here we have a few files:

- `tweet_pgh_images.csv` and friends: all tweets with pictures in our twitter data. Column 2 is longitude, 3 is latitude, 4 is date, 5 is time, 7 is neighborhood, 8 is photo URL.
- `austin_yfcc100m.csv` and friends: all created with `neighborhood_guides/aesthetic/make_all_yfcc100m_nghd_dumps.sh` and then used `neighborhood_guides/data/add_nghd_to_yfcc.py` to add the neighborhood.
